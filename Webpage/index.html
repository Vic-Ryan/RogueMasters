        <h3>Corey Pfleiger</h3>
        <p>
            I am Corey, generally considered to be a good person with a large list of hobbies and skills. I have
            traveled many place both in country and internationally. Being the rather directer person I
            am I dont like to fill in my bio with flowery text or try terribly hard to make myself look extravagantly
            good in the eyes of anyone. I am but a humen on the great road of life looking to spend
            time gathering knowledge and having great conversations. I have two children that are
            a major part of my life, they are one of the greatest gifts life has ever given me I only hope
            that I can be a father that they look up to and are inspired by.
