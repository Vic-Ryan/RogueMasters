                <p>After my withdrawl, I knew I wanted to go back into it, so I joined ElevenFifty to help pursue a career ready status, without the hastle I felt I would get through a normal college degree.</p>
                <p>My only greviance, however, is some of the languages we've been learning. You see, I was hoping we'd go more into morse rather than C#.</p>
